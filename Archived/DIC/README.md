This folder contains the raw data from the DIC analysis for days 0-14, as well as the processing excel document (processed_DIC_template 1.xlsx). The ManuallyProcessed folder contains data processed using the excel document. The DIC_Raw_Data_Digestion folder contains the DIC_Data_Digestion.Rmd developed from the data processing excel sheet. This markdown attempts to perform the same process as the processed_DIC_template 1.xlsx, and the results of this code are in the Data_processed folder.
